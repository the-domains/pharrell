Why I'm Absolutely an Angry Black Woman - THOSE PEOPLE - Medium

Because when I was five, my kindergarten classmate told me I couldn't be the princess in the game we were playing because black girls couldn't be princesses. Because I was in third grade the first time a teacher seemed shocked at how "well-spoken" I was. Because in fourth grade I was told my crush didn't like black girls. Because in sixth grade a different crush told me I was pretty --- for a black girl. Because in 7th grade my predominantly black suburban neighborhood was nicknamed "Spring Ghettos" instead of calling it its name (Spring Meadows). Because I was in 8th grade the first time I was called an Oreo and told that I "wasn't really black" like it was a compliment.
