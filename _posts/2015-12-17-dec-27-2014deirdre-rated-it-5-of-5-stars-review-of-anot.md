> Dec 27, 2014Deirdre  \*  I love reading and while I did receive a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review it didn't influence the following review. When I first started reading this I was afraid that it was the typical YA romance, I am glad to say that I was very wrong! Myla is a strong teenage girl forced to live in solitude while Blake is a carefree guy. the only way they get to see each other is in their dreams. I really didn't want this to end, and even though I really really don't like cliffhanger endings I respect the significance they play in enticing the reader to crave more. I cannot wait for the next part!
