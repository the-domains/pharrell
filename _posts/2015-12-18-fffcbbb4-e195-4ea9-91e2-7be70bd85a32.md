# A Story of Many Songs (Book 2: Loss)
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9e75b10ddc45ef069959fcbcdc4a381a7c39a08a.jpg)

In the storm

Of dust and flying trees

In the chaos

Of a people conflicted

Running to safety

The enemy has come

And I must find a way to leave

I don't know how much

I can bear to lose

But I know this

Everything is about to change
