# A Story of Many Songs (Book 1: Love)
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e5cac4ea25f21f539e9260f625f30869e668a6f9.jpg)

I had a dream of a boy.

He was from Earth.

I am not.

He gave me an iPod.

I woke up holding an iPod.

I fell in love.

We had more dreams.

I would like to believe in this.

But I am out of time,

and they are after my life.
