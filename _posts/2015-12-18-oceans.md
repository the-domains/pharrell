I don't know if I should tell you

about the walk in the cold night,

or about falling from the sky.

I don't know if we should talk

about love, or pain.

I like to dwell on joy,

but then what about the gaps

in the timelines of our days

that just fade into irrelevance?

If there's one thing that interests

me the most,

it's the fact that you just

might read this book,

for no super significant reason,

other than to be my eyes

and my heart for 20 minutes.

And before you go looking

for stories and stories.

I must warn you. You will

find stories and stories,

but they are not stories and stories.

Oceans is a book of dreams,

read it like a dream.

Read it just before you sleep.
