i was never born to answer questions i am here to hear my footsteps crunch the snow as my toes cringe to the cold like icy water in my shoes and that is not a question i am here to see the crumpled leaves and twigs the squirrels scampering at the sound of my breath that condenses before my face i speak not for a question the chilly air sharpens the colors of my day until all is real and i cannot deny it and i am left with no hunger for thought this is the answer i was that there is no purpose in life except life's perfect form and there is no purpose at all except my perfect form and this my body is free without a question for it is God who made me a hungry sabbath for winter pharrell douglas
